	<h2>A Response to <a href="http://contemporary-home-computing.org/turing-complete-user/">Olia Lialina's 'Turing Complete User'</a> & The Following Questions</h2>

	<a href="#question1">What do you think is Lialina's opinion of the word "user"?</a>
	<br /><a href="#question2">What is Lialina's ideal internet user? Provide some of the qualities that she outlines.</a>
	<br /><a href="#question3">From your own experiences interacting on the webâ€”what is an example where there are "gaps that can be filled by users"?</a>


	<p><a id="question1"></a>The word (and concept of the) "user", in Lialina's opinion, is a necessary one. She asserts that technological experiences should be recognizable as such -- that we should be aware that the computer is not an extension of ourselves, but a tool and service to be used; additionally, that technology's design should not only allow for but reinforce that awareness, rather than striving to hide it. Ultimately, she is concerned that the shift away from the word "user" obscures the underlying hierarchy (developer > user) and allows for abuse of that hierarchy and the reduction of the rights of the person - the user.  Accepting the computer as an extension of the self discards concerns like being able to restrict permissions, opt out - it removes the idea of engaging with programs in the way that you choose to rather than the way that is decided for you. (This ties in to some of what you were discussing in class, Ali; the idea that the internet as we know it is now made up of platforms - decided for us - rather than websites built and maintained by people we know or us ourselves.)</p>
	<br />

	<p><a id="question2"></a>The ideal internet user... to directly quote Lialina, "users who have the ability to achieve their goals regardless of the primary purpose of an application or device." It's the ability to engage with the internet as a tool that is not necessary - to be able to disregard the "decided for us" element of the internet, and move around and through these concepts. The ideal user is able to explore the internet as a kind of free space, a space for experimentation and redefinition, and accomplish what they mean to without (or with minimally) compromising that freedom.</p>
	<br />

	<p><a id="question3"></a>Before Spotify, there was this at-least-two-step process that organically developed for sharing playlists: you built a playlist on 8tracks, either designed or found your cover art, then laid out the tracklist within the same aesthetic and uploaded both these photos, plus the playlist link, to Tumblr. The idea was to not only share the playlist and its track listing (not viewable on 8tracks), but to create a visual that illustrated and evoked the theme/mood of the playlist. For example, a playlist focused on difficulties in relationships might have a cover photo using a crop of some kind of dramatic Renaissance painting, and the track listing would likely be a different crop of that same painting. Serif font, for sure.
	</p>

	<p>The gap that was initially being responded to was the lack of tracklisting on 8tracks - at the start of this whole concept, your post might just be an upload of a screenshot of the playlist cover photo and the track list in plain text as the caption. Somehow it morphed into this need to visually express an audio experience, and in the process a whole bunch of people decided to stitch together two platforms and learn PhotoShop to pull this all off. Nothing has ever actually filled that gap, but with Spotify's readily visible track lists, it's gone out of fashion. It was an interesting moment, though.</p>
